## *Science Fiction and Techno Orientalism*
##### Do Americans turn to science fiction when threatened with East Asian success?

## Goals
##### *Contribute to existing discussions about techno orientalism
##### *Create visuals that are easy to understand
##### +I don't know how to tally up the variables that I need, and it's making my graph confusing
##### ""This is data science""
